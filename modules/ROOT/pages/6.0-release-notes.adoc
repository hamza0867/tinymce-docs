=== Removed or deprecated APIs

[id=removed-or-deprecated-apis-tables]
==== Table

* The `table` plugin’s functionality is, as of {productname} 6.0, entirely focussed on the user interface (UI) for creating and editing tables.

  The code that generates tables is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

  Since the `table` plugin API was entirely concerned with generating tables, it has been removed.

// Don’t forget to set a visual check mark of some sort to denote the removal or deprecation of any previously undocumented things.

[id=new-and-improved-plugins]
=== New and improved plugins

[id=new-and-improved-plugins-imagetools]
==== EditImage

NOTE: _EditImage_, a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin], replaces the now-deprecated and removed _ImageTools_ plugin. The `imagetools` plugin is no longer part of the Core open source editor.

* The `editimage` plugin shows real-time updates of images as they are edited.

* `editimage` also offers two new options:

   1. `editimage_proxy_service_url` and

   2. `export_image_proxy_service_url`.

  These new options provide access to Tiny-specific services.
  
NOTE: `editimage_proxy` (the re-named equivalent to the previous `imagetools_proxy`) still works. It is the fallback option should the Tiny-specific services not be available.



[id=new-and-improved-plugins-emoticons]
==== Emoticons

* The `emoticon` plugin now uses the more accurate word, _Emoji_, in its tool bar, menu item and dialogue box.

   In previous versions, the word presented in these parts of the plugin’s user-interface was _Emoticon_.

   NOTE: The plugin, itself, is still called Emoticons. And the plugin description and the plugin’s configuration and Help dialogues still reflect this.


[id=new-and-improved-plugins-table-of-contents]
==== Table of contents

* the `toc` plugin has modernised its output. It now uses the ES2020 library and targets ES2018. As well, it now uses https://terser.org[terser] to improve performance.

  NOTE: this new version of the `toc` plugin is no longer part of the Core open source editor. Table of Contents is now a https://tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/#productivity[Premium plugin].


[id=changed-plugins]
=== Changed plugins

[id=changed-plugins-autoresize]
==== Autoresize

* Previously, the `autoresize` plugin offered an `autoresize_on_init` option.

  This setting does not do anything meaningful, and had been previously deprecated.
  
  As of {productname} 6.0, it has been removed from the `autoresize` plugin.

[id=changed-plugins-media]
==== Media

* In {productname} 5.x, the `media` plugin used SaxParser to validate elements for parsing.

  As of {productname} 6.0, SaxParser is no longer used.
  
  As a consequence the `iframe`, `video`, `audio`, and `object` elements are no longer marked as _special_. Instead their contents are simply validated against the schema.

* The `media` plugin’s `media_scripts` option was deprecated in {productname} 5.10.

  As of this release, {productname} 6.0, this option has been removed completely.

[id=changed-plugins-noneditable]
==== Noneditable

* The `noneditable` plugin is no longer a plugin. It is now  a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

   In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

[id=changed-plugins-paste]
==== Paste

* The `paste` plugin’s functionality is now  a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

   In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

* The `paste_data_images` option now defaults to `true`. When `paste` was a plugin, this option was, by default, set to `false`, which prevented images being pasted from the local machine.

[id=changed-plugins-print]
==== Print

* `print` functionality is no longer a plugin. It is now  a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

   In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

[id=changed-plugins-table]
==== Table

* The `table` plugin’s functionality is, as of {productname} 6.0, entirely focussed on the user interface (UI) for creating and editing tables.

  The code that generates tables is now a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

* If the selected cells in the `tfoot` section of a table were header elements (ie were `th` elements), pressing the `table` row header toolbar button (which invokes the `mceTableRowType` command) returned the row as a header row.

  This was incorrect: the section takes precedence and cells in the `tfoot` section of a table should be declared as a footer row.

  In {productname} 6.0, selecting cells in the `tfoot` section of a table and pressing the row header toolbar button returns the row as a footer row, as expected.

* `mceInsertTableDialog` is the new command for invoking an insert table dialogue box.

   The previous command, `mceInsertTable`, no longer works: use the `mceInsertTableDialog` command instead.

* The default values for the `table_style_by_css` and the `table_use_colgroups` options have both been changed.

  Previously, these options defaulted to `false`. As of {productname} 6.0, both options now default to `true`.

  This is in line with modern web practice.

* the `table_responsive_width` option was previously deprecated and superseded by `table_sizing_mode`.

  In {productname} 6.0, the `table_responsive_width` option has been removed.

[id=changed-plugins-textpattern]
==== TextPattern

* the `textpattern_patterns` plugin is no longer a plugin. It is has been re-named, to `text_patterns` and is now  a Core part of {productname} 6.0.

   In {productname} 6.0, there is no setting or specifying this functionality in the `plugins` option.

   Also, the API called `textpattern` has been removed.

   Finally, text patterns are now on by default. `text_patterns: false` or `text_patterns: []` turns the functionality off.
